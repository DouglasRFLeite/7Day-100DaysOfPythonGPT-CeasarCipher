# 8Day-100DaysOfPythonGPT-CeasarCipher
Day 8 of the [100 Days of Code with Python Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) from Udemy.

## What is 100DaysOfPythonGPT?

100 Days of Python is a Python Bootcamp from Udemy that provides 100 days of Python pratical content with lessons and projects. The GPT part is something I'm adding to the course and infers that I shall use ChatGPT's engine and/or API in some way on each and every one of those 100 projects. Furthermore, I shall also practice using PyTest to test these projects and applications at least in some level.

## CeasarCipher

Ceasar Cipher is the eight project of the eight day of the bootcamp. It seeks to enhance the use of functions. 

Ceaser Cipher is a way of encrypting text by shifting every letter by some number. In theory, this encryption can only be undone with the knowledge of such number. In the code, the user is asked for a word to be encrypted, as well as the shift number, and responded to with the ciphered word. Right after the user is asked for a word to be deciphered and the shift number, they are responded with the deciphered word.

There are no uses for ChatGPT's API in this project.

## Project Structure

 - [src/](src/) - The `ceaser_cipher.py` file holds the cipher and decipher functions, as well as an interface function that handles user interaction.
